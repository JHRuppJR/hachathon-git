# How we collaborate and accelerate the use of Red Hat products and Open Source Software

## Problem Statement

Enabling large organizations to adopt technologies is more than just purchasing a sku there are multiple building blocks that need to be put in place such as tooling security and learning new skills.

## Objective

Create a framework to enable people on this journey using discovery sessions that we will outline in this repository as well as provide enablement workshops to help move them forward.

## Enablement Workshops

These workshops will consist of 2 days of intensive training on a technology followed by 3 days of applying what was learned to a real business problem.

### Example: We would like to migrate a leagacy application to a container

Workshop would consist of training on OpenShift, application refactoring, CI/CD and modern application development.
