# How We Enable Open Source Software

## Problem Statement

Enabling large organizations to use technologies to their fullest potential is more than just purchasing a product, there are multiple building blocks that need to be put in place such as architecture, tooling, security and learning new skills.

## Objective

Create a framework to enable people on their digital transformation journey using discovery sessions that we will outline in this repository as well as provide enablement workshops to help move them forward and create communities of practice within their organizations. In addition to this we hope to enable other repositories start including a workshop folder that walks people through how to run workshops so that others can use them as part of their enablement going forward.

## Why Strategy Matters

"Formalizing your organizationâ€™s approach to open source management and strategy creates guidelines that boost efficiency and minimize risks. Whether or not you have set a business strategy around your open source efforts, you likely already know that this is important." - Linuxfoundation.org

At the highest level having company standards around the way IT services are delivered is one of the most important things to address in order to help accelerate the adoption of open source software and tools.

We have created an Assessment worksheet to help document where an organization is in this journey here: [Opensource Assessment](workshops/how_we_enable/01-Getting_Started.md)

## Enablement Workshops

These workshops (preferably) consist of 2 days of intensive training on a technology followed by 3 days of applying what was learned to a real business problem.

`Note:` This can be broken down into smaller sessions as it is sometimes difficult to get an entire week. The main goal is to have people apply the new skills they learned as soon as possible to something they are currently working on.
