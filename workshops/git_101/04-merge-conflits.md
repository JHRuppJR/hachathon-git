# Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts happen when you or someone else edits the same file and tries to push into a remote branch. This is common when multiple people are working on the code base. A good way to make sure this does not happen is to `git pull origin main` often if you know others may be working on the same files.

`Note:` Main could be called master if it is an older repository.
