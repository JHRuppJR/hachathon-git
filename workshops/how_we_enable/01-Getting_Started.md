# Getting Started

## How To Use

The first thing we need to do before anything else is get a full understanding of tools, developers, architectures, security and best practices. In order to do this we have created a checklist to simplify the process. Use this as a conversation starter `NOT` as a survey.

As this is open source please feel free to put in a PR to add to this list.

Here is an example of what a this would look like for containerization:

| **Containerization** | Containers are not understood or used by any teams | Containers have been explored conceptually by at least one team, but never implemented in production | Containers are used by at least one team as their preferred hosting framework in production | Containers are widely used, but orchestration of containers is not formalized across the organization | Containers are widely used and orchestration of containers is well defined across the organization |
